RAG With Fast API
This project is a FastAPI-based web application that functions as a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI assistant for a Thai online shop. It helps customers find products by answering their questions accurately and politely in Thai, leveraging product data and conversational memory.

Key Features & Technologies:

Conversational AI: Provides natural language interaction with customers in Thai.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant product information from a database.

Local LLM Integration: Utilizes a local Ollama server running the gemma3:1b model for generating responses and query rewriting, ensuring data privacy and potentially faster inference.
